## Running the App with `--dart-define`

To run the app with an API key use the `--dart-define` flag, follow these steps:

1. **Set Your API Key**: Make sure you have your API key ready. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key.

2. **Run the App with `--dart-define`**: Use the following command to run your Flutter app, passing the API key as a Dart define:

   ```bash
   flutter run --dart-define=API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
